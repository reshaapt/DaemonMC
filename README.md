Instead of vanilla features and mechanics, here game is completely driven by plugins. DaemonMC provide only server core with simple API so you can add only what you need. No unnecessary server resources and network usage by various features like block tick or mobs.

To learn how to create plugins check [Plugin tutorial](https://github.com/TeamDeamonMC/DaemonMC/wiki/Plugin-tutorial)

## Getting started

Download latest .zip from [Releases](https://github.com/TeamDeamonMC/DaemonMC/releases). Unzip and run DaemonMC.exe.
This action will create: 
- Plugins (for plugin .dll files)
- Plugins/SharedLibraries (for library .dll files that are used by plugins)
- Resource Packs (for resource pack .mcpack files and .key files for encrypted packs)
- Worlds (for world .mcworld files)
- DaemonMC.yaml (more info [wiki#daemonmcyaml](https://github.com/TeamDeamonMC/DaemonMC/wiki#daemonmcyaml))

For updating you will need to download latest .dll from [Releases](https://github.com/TeamDeamonMC/DaemonMC/releases) and replace with old one.

> [!NOTE]
Server don't have it's own world generator (only temporary flat world when starting server without .mcworld file) so you will need to use your own .mcworld file in Worlds folder.

## Features

**Up to date resources:** This software will always support latest world format, entities, sounds and all other things found in latest Minecraft version.

**Multiversion:** To make updating easier for players and servers, this software supports also previous game versions.
Just remember that because of the latest world format, players using older game versions won't be able to see blocks added in new versions.

**Multiworld:** You can have as many worlds as you want. Just specify spawn world name in ```DaemonMC.yaml``` and use API ([ChangeWorld(World, Vector3)](https://github.com/TeamDeamonMC/DaemonMC/wiki/Plugin-API-(Methods)#changeworldworld-vector3).) to transfer players to other worlds.

**Simple plugin API:** Plugin tutoral, API and other useful things can be found in [Wiki](https://github.com/TeamDeamonMC/DaemonMC/wiki).
